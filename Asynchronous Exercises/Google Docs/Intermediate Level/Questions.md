1. Write a function that chains two Promises together, where the second Promise depends on the result of the first.

2. Create an `async` function that performs three asynchronous operations sequentially and logs the result of each.

3. Using Promises, write a function that makes two API requests in parallel and logs both results.

4. Create a debounced function using `setTimeout` that only executes the provided function after 300ms of inactivity.

5. Write a function that uses `Promise.all` to wait for multiple Promises to resolve and then logs the results.

6. Implement a simple polling mechanism that fetches data from an API every 5 seconds until a condition is met.

7. Create a retry mechanism for an asynchronous function that retries up to 3 times before failing.

8. Write an `async` function that fetches data from two APIs sequentially using `await`.

9. Implement a simple timeout wrapper for a Promise that rejects if the Promise does not resolve within a specified time.

10. Write a function that handles multiple asynchronous operations, ensuring they complete in a specific order using Promises.
