In a quiet village, a boy named Eli found an old, rusted key buried beneath a willow tree.\nNo one knew what it opened, but every night, he dreamed of a glowing door in the forest.\nOne evening, drawn by moonlight, he followed his dreams and discovered the door—real and shimmering.\nWith trembling hands, Eli turned the key.\nThe door creaked open, revealing a world filled with music, color, and laughter—echoes of forgotten joy.\nHe stepped through, leaving behind the ordinary world.\nThe next morning, villagers found the key lying by the willow again, waiting for the next dreamer.
